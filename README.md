# Indian Leader Classifier

## Overview

The Indian Leader Classifier is a simple image classification project that utilizes a Haar Cascade Classifier to identify and classify images of prominent Indian leaders. The project is focused on recognizing five specific leaders: Amit Shah, M.K. Stalin, Sonia Gandhi, Nirmala Sitharaman, and Sushma Swaraj.

## Project Components

- **Haar Cascade Classifier:** The classifier is trained to detect facial features and recognize the specified leaders in images.
- **Web Interface:** The project provides a user-friendly web interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can drop images onto the interface to get real-time classification results.
- **Classifier Output:** Along with the classified leader, the system displays a paragraph introducing the identified person.

## Potential Applications

The Indian Leader Classifier has potential applications in various scenarios, especially in a professional context:

- **Company Directories:** In growing companies or offices, the system can be adapted to recognize and display information about professionals within the organization.
- **Team Introductions:** During team meetings or events, the classifier can be used to quickly introduce team members and their roles.
